# hello-world
This is a test to validate repository creation for account pasikoski.

My name is Pasi Koski. I'm a software developer from Finland. I've
been using Git for a couple of years now and I really like it.
I do not miss SVN and I do certainly not miss CVS or ClearCase. :)

I plan on using this Github account as a repository for some demo and
test projects.
